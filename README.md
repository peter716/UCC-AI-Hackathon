This repository contains our work and experiments from the inaugural UCC AI Hackathon. My team investigated various models including UNET, DeepLabv3 enhanced by ASPP and ResNet-101, and Fully Convolutional Networks with ResNet-101. We also experimented with predominantly geometric augmentation techniques and implemented a scheduler to manage the learning rates during training. Our efforts led us to become finalists in the competition, and we presented our work, which is showcased in this [Twitter post](https://x.com/ChrysNgwa/status/1761432233200566592).
